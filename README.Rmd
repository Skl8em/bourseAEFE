# bourseAEFE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Propose des fonctions qui facilite la verification et le d√©bat autour du calcul des bourse de l'AEFE. Ces fonctions n'existe qu'a titre indicatif, 

## Installation

You can install the development version of bourseAEFE like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Skl8em/bourseAEFE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bourseAEFE)

salaire <- 5000
scolarite <- 1000
IPPA <- 0.8
tx <- 1

(q <- quotient_final(salaire, scolarite, 3, IPPA, tx, 0.07))

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
